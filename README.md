# Investigating host transcriptional responses through RNA Microarray Analysis - Learn to Use R
Workshop on transcriptome sequencing analysis 
# üß¨ Transcriptomics Workshop

Welcome to the official repository for the **Transcriptomics Data Analysis Workshop**. This hands-on workshop is designed to guide participants through the essential steps of transcriptome data analysis, from raw reads to biological interpretation using modern bioinformatics tools and R programming.

## Preparing Gene Lists for Enrichment

To prepare your gene list, you may want to convert gene symbols to Entrez IDs or other identifiers. Here's an example in **R**:

```r
# Read in your differential expression results
d <- read.csv("Analysis_CoVvsHealthy.csv", header = TRUE)

# Extract data from genelist
geneList <- d[, 2]
names(geneList) <- as.character(d[, 1])

# Sort the gene list (e.g., fold changes)
geneList <- sort(geneList, decreasing = TRUE)

# View the top genes
head(geneList)
# View the genelist
View(d)

# Filter significant genes (e.g., |logFC| > 2)
gene <- names(geneList)[abs(geneList) > 2]
head(gene)
