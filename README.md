# RNA2Insights
Workshop on transcriptome sequencing analysis 
# üß¨ Transcriptomics Workshop

Welcome to the official repository for the **Transcriptomics Data Analysis Workshop**. This hands-on workshop is designed to guide participants through the essential steps of transcriptome data analysis, from raw reads to biological interpretation using modern bioinformatics tools and R programming.
